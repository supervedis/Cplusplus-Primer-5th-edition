# Exercise 2.19: Explain the key differences between pointers and references.

1. A reference has to be initilized when declared while a pointer doesn't necessarily have to.
2. A reference can not be reassigned to another varible while a pointer can be reassigned to another variable of the same type.
3. A reference is not an object while a pointer is.
