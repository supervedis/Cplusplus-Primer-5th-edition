# Exercises Section 2.2.1

## Exercise 2.9: Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal,explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.

**(a) std::cin >> int input_value;**
Type must always come first in a statement.
**(b) int i = { 3.14 };**
Initialization with the aid of parenthesis is usually strict. The compiler rejects this as there might be loss of data.
**(c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;**
wage is undefined before use.
**(d) int i = 3.14;**
i will contain the integer 3 due to truncation of the 3.14 float value.
