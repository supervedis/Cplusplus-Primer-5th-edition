# Exercises Section 2.2.1

## Exercise 2.9: Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal,explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it.

**(a)**<code>std::cin >> int input_value;</code>  
Type must always come first in a statement.  
**(b)**<code>int i = { 3.14 };</code>  
Initialization with the aid of parenthesis is usually strict. The compiler rejects this as there might be loss of data.  
**(c)**<code>double salary = wage = 9999.99;</code>  
wage is undefined before use.  
**(d)**<code>int i = 3.14;</code>  
i will contain the integer 3 due to truncation of the 3.14 float value.
