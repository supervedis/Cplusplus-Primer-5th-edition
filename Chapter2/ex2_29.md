# Exercise 2.29: Using the variables in the previous exercise, which of the following assignments are legal? Explain why.

(a) i = ic;
Illegal as ic was not initialized.
(b) p1 = p3;
A constant pointer to an int that's constant cannot be assigned to a non-const pointer to an int.
This is the case as p1 can change the value of the address that p3 points to, to avoid this, p1 should be a pointer
to an int constant. _const int *p1 = p3;_
(c) p1 = &ic;
Illegal. A const int cannot be assigned to a pointer to int. If it were possible, there would be risks of changing the constant integer
from the pointer.
(d) p3 = &ic;
Legal. p3 is a constant pointer that points to an int constant in this case ic.
(e) p2 = p1;
Legal. A pointer of obect type int that's constant. p2 has an address of another pointer to int.
(f) ic = *p3;
Legal. ic is a is an int constant that is being initialized with a constant point that's pointing to an constant meaning,
neither the address it holds nor the contentsin that address can be changed.
