# Exercise 2.27: Which of the following initializations are legal? Explain why

<code>(a) int i = -1, &r = 0;</code>
i = -1 is legal as int is signed.
&r = 0 is illegal since a literal cannot be assigned to a reference.
<code>(b) int *const p2 = &i2;</code>
Legal only if i2 is of a const int type.
<code>(c) const int i = -1, &r = 0;</code>
i is legal as it is an int constant.
&r is legal since const references can be initialized with literals.
<code>(d) const int*const p3 = &i2;</code>
Legal. This is a constant pointer to a constant int object type.
p3 cannot hold any other address when initialized neither can it be used to change the value at the address it contains.
<code>(e) const int *p1 = &i2;</code>
Legal. We can assign a different address to p1, however, the value in the address it points to can never be modified.
<code>(f) const int &const r2;</code>
Illegal. Reference variable r2 needs to be initialized.
<code>(g) const int i2 = i, &r = i;</code>
Legal. A variable that has been declared and initialized can be assigned to a type that's const.
