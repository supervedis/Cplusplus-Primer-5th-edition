# Exercise 2.35: Determine the types deduced in each of the following definitions. Once youâ€™ve figured out the types, write a program to see whether you were correct

<code>const int i = 42;</code>
<code>auto j = i; const auto &k = i; auto *p = &i;</code>
j is an int
k is a const int&
p is a const int*

<code>const auto j2 = i, &k2 = i;</code>
j2 is a const int
k2 is a const int&
