# Exercise 2.31: Given the declarations in the previous exercise determine  whether the following assignments are legal. Explain how the top-level or low-level const applies in each case. 

<code>r1 = v2;</code>
Illegal. The top-const in v2 must also be present in r1 as references should always have the same base type as the variables they refer to.
<code>p1 = p2;    p2 = p1;</code>
p1 = p2 is illegal as low-level const are not ignored during copying.
p2 = p1 is legal. A value of a non-const(p1) can be copied to a low-level const(p2), however, p2 can not be used to change what is points to.
<code>p1 = p3;    p2 = p3;</code>
p1=p3 is illegal. p3 is a low-level const being assigned to a non-const which is not permitted.
p2=p3 is legal as both are low-level const pointers.
