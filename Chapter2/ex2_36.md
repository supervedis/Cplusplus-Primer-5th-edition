# Exercise 2.36: In the following code, determine the type of each variable and the value each variable has when the code finishes:

<code>int a = 3, b = 4;</code>
a is int with value 3
b is int with value 4
<code>decltype(a) c = a;</code>
c is int with value 3
<code>decltype((b)) d = a;</code>
d is int& referencing a with value 3
<code>++c;</code>
4
<code>++d;</code>
4
