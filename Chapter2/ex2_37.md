# Exercise 2.37: Assignment is an example of an expression that yields a reference type. The type is a reference to the type of the left-hand operand. That is,if i is an int, then the type of the expression i = x is int&. Using that knowledge, determine the type and value of each variable in this code:

<code>int a = 3, b = 4;</code>
a is an int with value 3, b is an int with value 4
<code>decltype(a) c = a;</code>
c is an int with value 3
<code>decltype(a = b) d = a;</code>
Since a = b is an expression, it yields a reference, thus d is a reference to a.
