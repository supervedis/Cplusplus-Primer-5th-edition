# Exercise 2.33: Using the variable definitions from this section, determine what happens in each of these assignments:

<code>a = 42;   b = 42;   c = 42;</code>
a's deduced type is an int from the initial initialization, a is assigned a new value of 42.
b is an int and it is assigned a new value of 42.
c is an int from the initial initialization which dropped the top level const, therefore, c is assigned 42;
<code>d = 42;   e = 42;   g = 42;</code>
d is a pointer, assigning a literal to d is not permitted.
e is a pointer to a const int, only an address to an int is allowed.
g is a const int&, attempting to change the value of a constant int through a reference is not permitted.
