# Exercise 2.30: For each of the following declarations indicate whether the object being declared has top-level or low-level const.

<code>**const int v2 = 0;    int v1 = v2;**</code>
v2 is a top level const. v1 is a non-const object whose value is a copy of v1, this assignment is permitted as v2's top-level const
is ignored while copying.
<code>int *p1 = &v1, &r1 = v1;</code>
Non of top-level or low-level const.
<code>const int *p2 = &v2, *const p3 = &i, &r2 = v2;</code>
p2 is a low-level const.
p3 is both a top-level and a low-level const.
r2 is a low-level const in a reference.
