# Exercise 2.25: Determine the types and values of each of the following variables.

**(a)**<code> int* ip, &r = ip;</code>   
ip is a pointer to an int and it's initial value is zero(NULL pointer) as initialized by some compilers if initialization wasn't done.
r is a reference to a type int. It cannot be initialized to a pointer, so, the initialization is an error.   
**(b)**<code>int i, *ip = 0;</code>     
Declaration of int variable i and pointer variable ip.   
i is initialized to zero while ip is initialized to a NULL.      
**(c)** <code>int *ip, ip2;</code>     
Declaration of ip as a pointer to an int and ip2 as an int.   
Both are initialized to 0 being the compiler default values.
