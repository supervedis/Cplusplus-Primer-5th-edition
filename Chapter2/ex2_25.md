# Exercise 2.25: Determine the types and values of each of the following variables.

**(a) int* ip, &r = ip;**
ip is a pointer to an int and it's initial value is zero(NULL pointer) as initialized by some compilers if initialization wasn't done.
r is a reference to a type int. It cannot be initialized to a pointer, so, the initialization is an error.
**(b) int i, *ip = 0;**
Declaration of int variable i and pointer variable ip.
i is initialized to zero while ip is initialized to a NULL.
**(c) int* ip, ip2;**
Declaration of ip as a pointer to an int and ip2 as an int.
Both are initialized to 0 being the compiler default values.
