# Exercise 2.21: Explain each of the following definitions. Indicate whether any are illegal and, if so, why.

**int i = 0;**
Declaration and initialization of an int.
**(a) double* dp = &i;**
Illegal. A pointer can only be initialized with the same type.
**(b) int *ip = i;**
Only addresses are allowed as values of type pointer and not primitive values.
**(c) int *p = &i;**
Valid. Pointer p is initialized with the address of i.
