# Exercise 2.32: Is the following code legal or not? If not, how might you make it legal?

<code>int null = 0, *p = null;</code>
null is a value of type int and it cannot be used to initialize a pointer. Instead a null pointer is the 
desired value, then p should be initialized with the predefined nullptr constant or the literal zero. 
Below are ways to correct the initialization.
1. <code>p = 0;</code>
2. <code>p=&null;</code>
3. <code>p=nullptr;</code>
