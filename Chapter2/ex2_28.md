# Exercise 2.28: Explain the following definitions. Identify any that are illegal.

<code>(a) int i, *const cp;</code>
i is an int object type.
cp is a constant pointer. This is illegal since it hasn't been initialized.
<code>(b) int *p1, *const p2;</code>
p1 is a pointer to an int object type.
p2 is a constant pointer of int type. This is illegal as it has to be initialized.
<code>(c) const int ic, &r = ic;</code>
ic is an int contant and it is illegal as it requires to be initialized.
r is a reference of type int which is a constant.
<code>(d) const int *const p3;</code>
p3 is a constant pointer of type int which points to an int constant. It is illegal since it requires an
initializer.
<code>(e) const int *p;</code>
This is a declaration of a pointer to an int object that's a constant.
