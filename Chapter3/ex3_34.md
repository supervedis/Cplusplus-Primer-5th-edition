# Exercise 3.34: Given that p1 and p2 point to elements in the same array, what does the following code do? Are there values of p1 or p2 that make this code illegal?

<code>p1 += p2 - p1;</code>   
p1 is an offset of the difference between p2 and p1.   
It is illegal if p1 or p2 does not point to an element in the array or they are past the end of the array.
