# Exercise 3.19: List three ways to define a vector and give it ten elements, each with the value 42. Indicate whether there is a preferred way to do so and why.

<code>vector<int> ivec(10,42);</code>
<code>vector<int> ivec{42,42,42,42,42,42,42,42,42,42};</code>
<code>vector<int> ivec = {42,42,42,42,42,42,42,42,42,42};</code>
