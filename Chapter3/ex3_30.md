# Exercise 3.30: Identify the indexing errors in the following code:

<code>
constexpr size_t array_size = 10;
int ia[array_size];
for (size_t ix = 1; ix <= array_size; ++ix)
      ia[ix] = ix;
</code>
ix should have been initialized to for the loop to subscript the array from 0 to 9. Plus ix <= array_size should be ix < array_size.
