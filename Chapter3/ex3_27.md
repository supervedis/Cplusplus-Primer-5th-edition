# Exercise 3.27: Assuming txt_size is a function that takes no arguments and returns an int value, which of the following definitions are illegal? Explain why.

<code>unsigned buf_size = 1024;</code>
<code>(a) int ia[buf_size];</code>
Illegal. buf_size is not a constant expression. Though some compilers allow this.
<code>(b) int ia[4 * 7 - 14];</code>
Legal.
<code>(c) int ia[txt_size()];</code>
Legal only if txt_size() is a constant expression.
<code>(d) char st[11] = "fundamental";</code>
Illegal. st is an array that can hold 10 characters with room for the null operator, instead st has been initialized with 11 characters.
