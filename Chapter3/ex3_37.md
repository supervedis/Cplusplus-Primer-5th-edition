# Exercise 3.37: What does the following program do?

<code>
const char ca[] = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'};
const char *cp = ca;
while (*cp) {
    cout << *cp << endl;
    ++cp;
}
</code>   
This program loops through the ca array using the pointer cp displaying it's contents. Since there is no
null character in the array, the behaviour is undefined as the loop might keep on running till it finds a null character
outside the bounds of ca array.
