# Exercise 3.13: How many elements are there in each of the following vectors? What are the values of the elements?

(a) <code>vector<int> v1;</code>   
No elements as v1 is uninitialized.   
(b) <code>vector<int> v2(10);</code>   
10 int elements initizied to their default 0.   
(c) <code>vector<int> v3(10, 42);</code>   
v3 has 10 int elements all initialized to 42.   
(d) <code>vector<int> v4{10};</code>   
v4 is a vector initialized with one element.   
(e) <code>vector<int> v5{10, 42}</code>;    
v5 is initialized with two int elements.   
(f) <code>vector<string> v6{10};</code>   
v6 has 10 elements of type string initielized to their default empty.   
(g) <code>vector<string> v7{10, "hi"};</code>     
v7 has 10 elements all initialized to the string hi.
