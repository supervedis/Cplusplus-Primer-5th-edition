# Exercise 3.18: Is the following program legal? If not, how might you fix it?

<code>vector<int> ivec;
ivec[0] = 42;</code>   
This is invalid as ivec has been declared and not initialized nor a size determined for it.   
This can be rectified by either options below.   
<code>vector<int> ivec(1);</code>   
or   
<code>vector<int> ivec{1};</code>
